## [4.0.0](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/compare/v3.1.0...v4.0.0) (2021-08-18)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* The Cognito `IdToken` is now used instead of the `AccessToken` to authorize requests.

Multi-tenancy itself is not a breaking change, you can continue to use FHIR works on single-tenant mode 
by not using the `enableMultiTenancy` flag. 
  
However, note that updating an existing (single-tenant) stack to enable multi-tenancy is a breaking change. Multi-tenant 
deployments use a different data partitioning strategy that renders the old, single-tenant, data inaccessible. 

### Features

* Implement multi-tenancy and group export ([#416](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/416)) ([a9aebcc](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/commit/a9aebcc182255d305327463b1b2e0f7a463bad95)), closes [#348](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/348) [#347](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/347) [#367](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/367) [#381](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/381) [#387](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/387) [#384](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/384) [#389](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/389) [#392](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/392) [#397](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/397) [#393](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/393) [#398](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/398) [#399](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/399) [#400](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/400)
  
  Multi-tenancy allows a single `fhir-works-on-aws` stack to serve as multiple FHIR servers for different tenants.
  Check out our [multi-tenancy documentation](USING_MULTI_TENANCY.md) for more details.

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* FWoA now reads/writes Elasticsearch documents from aliases instead of indexes. This change simplifies performing re-indexing operations without downtime.
  Aliases are automatically created when resources are written to Elasticsearch, but read operations may fail for existing deployments if the aliases do not exist already.
* Please run the addAlias [script](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/blob/0f512c2169a8ad4805a82eed09b4196162d2ace2/scripts/elasticsearch-operations.js#L114-L125) created in this [PR](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/pull/346) BEFORE upgrading to 3.0.0 to create aliases for all existing indices 

### Features

* Use alias for all ES operations ([#349](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/349)) ([0f512c2](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/commit/0f512c2169a8ad4805a82eed09b4196162d2ace2))

### Added
- Search now supports `|` as part of token parameters. e.g. `GET [base]/Patient?identifier=http://acme.org/patient|2345`
- Search now supports using range prefixes for date parameters. e.g. `GET [base]/Patient?birthdate=ge2013-03-14`

   IG packages can now be included as part of the deployment. This enables search parameters and validation rules from profiles
   included in the IG. The capability statement is also updated to reflect those changes.
