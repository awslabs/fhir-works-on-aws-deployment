### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* FWoA now reads/writes Elasticsearch documents from aliases instead of indexes. This change simplifies performing re-indexing operations without downtime. Aliases are automatically created when resources are written to Elasticsearch, but read operations may fail for existing deployments if the aliases do not exist already.
* Please run the addAlias [script](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/blob/0f512c2169a8ad4805a82eed09b4196162d2ace2/scripts/elasticsearch-operations.js#L114-L125) created in this [PR](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/pull/346) BEFORE upgrading to 2.0.0-smart to create aliases for all existing indices

### Features

- Add support for Implementation Guides(IGs) ([#266](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/266))
