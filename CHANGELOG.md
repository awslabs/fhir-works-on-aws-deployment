## [2.2.0-smart](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/compare/v2.1.0-smart...v2.2.0-smart) (2021-08-24)


### Features

* implement multi-tenancy and group export  ([#421](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/421)) ([5335807](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/commit/5335807c1b295b3929b9259020b5d297c0a9ecac)), closes [#367](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/367) [#382](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/382) [#389](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/389) [#397](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/397) [#398](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/398) [#400](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/400) [#387](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/387) [#393](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/issues/393)
  
  Multi-tenancy allows a single `fhir-works-on-aws` stack to serve as multiple FHIR servers for different tenants.
  Check out our [multi-tenancy documentation](USING_MULTI_TENANCY.md) for more details.
  
  **NOTE:** Multi-tenancy itself is not a breaking change, you can continue to use FHIR works on single-tenant mode 
  by not using the `enableMultiTenancy` flag. 
  However, note that updating an existing (single-tenant) stack to enable multi-tenancy is a breaking change. Multi-tenant 
  deployments use a different data partitioning strategy that renders the old, single-tenant, data inaccessible.

## [2.0.0-smart](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/compare/v1.1.0-smart...v2.0.0-smart) (2021-06-25)

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* FWoA now reads/writes Elasticsearch documents from aliases instead of indexes. This change simplifies performing re-indexing operations without downtime. Aliases are automatically created when resources are written to Elasticsearch, but read operations may fail for existing deployments if the aliases do not exist already.
* Please run the addAlias [script](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/blob/0f512c2169a8ad4805a82eed09b4196162d2ace2/scripts/elasticsearch-operations.js#L114-L125) created in this [PR](https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-deployment/pull/346) BEFORE upgrading to 2.0.0-smart to create aliases for all existing indices
